UCI (**U**niversal **C**omputing **I**nterface) is a concept interface created by me. It was created beause I thought that the current existing interfaces could be improved, and we could make it one universal one instead without the hassle of needing different types. Installing is also no hassle with this interface, since it is a fully round-shaped (circle) port. Every 90 degrees has 120 pins, and with 360 degrees (90x4=360) makes the interface having 480 pins at the edges (D1). There is one big power pin in the center of the port (P1). Because of so many small pins, the bandwidth can be super high making speeds better (Up to 500Gbps!). Because everything is rounded it can be plugged in easily in any way (the chances of some pins in the cable not touching the pins in the port is so small) and even be rotated with no problems.
